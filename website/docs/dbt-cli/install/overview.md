title: "Installing dbt"
---

We recommend you use install dbt using one of four tried-and-tested methods:

- [Homebrew](install/homebrew) (recommended for MacOS)
- [pip](install/pip)
- [Docker image](install/docker)
- [from source](install/from-source)

dbt works with a number of different databases, query engines, and other SQL-speaking technologies. It does this by using a dedicated **adapter** for each. When you install dbt, you'll want to install the specific adapter for your database, too.
